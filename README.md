# CoolWeb
A simple contacts app implemented with some cool new web technologies

This started out as an old-school web app using traditional form submits and
full page refreshes, but it has morphed into a showcase of some cool new stuff:

- Node.js
- Express.js
- React.js
- Promises
- MongoDB in the cloud, hosted on AWS
- ES6 with classes, arrow functions, spread operators, and more
- Bootstrap
- Babel
- Browserify
- Single page app, responsive, and mobile friendly
