A simple contacts app implemented with some cool new web technologies

This started out as a simple old-school contacts app using traditional form submits and
full page refreshes, but it has morphed into a showcase of some cool new stuff:

Node.js with promises and the "co" module
MongoDB in the cloud, hosted on AWS
Single page app built with React.js
ES6 with classes, arrow functions, spread operators, and more
Bootstrap
Babel
Browserify
Responsive and mobile friendly
