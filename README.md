# CoolWeb
A simple contacts app implemented with some cool new web technologies

This started out as an old-school web app using traditional form submits and
full page refreshes, but it has morphed into a showcase of some cool new stuff:

- Node.js 8.x
- Express.js 4.x
- React.js 16.x
- React Router 4.x
- Promises
- MongoDB in the cloud, hosted on AWS
- ES6 with classes, arrow functions, spread operators, and more
- Bootstrap 4.0
- Babel
- Browserify
- Single page app, responsive, and mobile friendly
